#Basic plan and Log for Evolutionary Research 

1. Need to compile all pdbs to resequence on ProteinMPNN 

2. Compile groups of superfamilies at time and run on HPC 

3. While running compile another full CATH superfamily

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In terminal after compiling
scp -r Evolutionary_Research/CATH_db/{homology_family_name} ypark3@newhpc.hpc.oberlin.edu:

Compiled PDBS: 
3.10.50.20
